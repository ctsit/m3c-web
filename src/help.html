                        <h2>People Portal Help</h2>
                          <p>The Metabolomics Community People Portal is an information resource
                            for research and scholarship.  The People Portal organizes information
                            about metabolomics researchers and their work -- their activities,
                            interests, and accomplishments.  Information is assembled regarding people,
                            collaborators, projects, studies, publications, tools, datasets, and more.
                            The People Portal can be used to find potential collaborators and mentors,
                            to study aspects of inquiry, and to help understand the processes of
                            creating, transmitting and preserving knowledge.
                          </p>
                          <h3>New to the People Portal?</h3>
                          <p>Those new to the People Portal may wish to review the &quot;About People Portal&quot;
                            link below, which describes the VIVO technology that is used to support the semantic web
                            technology that underpins the People Portal, as well as background information provided
                            in &quot;Where does the People Portal get its data?,&quot; which describes methods used
                            by the Metabolomics Consortium Coordinating center to assemble and represent the research
                            activity of the Metabolomics Community.</p>

                          <p>&quot;Finding information in the People Portal&quot; provides additional material on
                            searching and exploring the Metabolomics community.  &quot;How to edit information&quot; addresses
                            adding and improving the information in the People Portal.</p>

                            <h3>Where does the People Portal get its data?</h3>
                            <p>The Metabolomics Consortium Coordinating Center's People Portal is sourced from two publicly
                            accessible datasets. The first data source is the
                            <a href="https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org">Metabolomics WorkBench</a> and the second source
                            is <a href="http://pubmed.gov">PubMed</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>The metadata found in the <a href="https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org">Metabolomics WorkBench</a>
                            is shared with the Metabolomics Consortium Coordinating Center as a monthly dataset that is ingested
                            through a series of scripts and transformations. These data are then loaded into an instance of
                            <a href="https://duraspace.org/vivo">VIVO</a> to create profiles that highlight research, publications,
                            data, and collaborations in the metabolomics community using triple pattern fragment (TPF) technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>The PubMed publication information is sourced from the  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api/">PubMed API</a>
                            and scripted to extract and load publication information for the relevant researchers' profile and
                            stored in <a href="https://duraspace.org/vivo">VIVO</a>.
                            </p>

                            <h3>How do I search?</h3>
                            <p>From the People Portal sub-menu, select the information sections for
                            <a href="https://people.metabolomics.info/people.html">people</a>,
                            <a href="https://people.metabolomics.info/people.html">publications</a>,

                              From these pages, type any phrase in the search box and the information will
                              automatically condense to display the relevant information for the
                              word entered. On the people page type in the word "Sara" for the page to only show people with the
                              name Sara among the researchers in the database or from the projects page type in the word
                              "kidney " to condense the information to projects related to kidney research.

                              Additionally, the box to the left of the information displayed on each page represents
